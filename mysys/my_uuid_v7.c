  implements Universal Unique Identifiers version 7, as described in
  draft-ietf-uuidrev-rfc4122bis-14.

  A UUIDv7 has the following structure:

  Field                       Octet #          Note
 unix_ts_ms                    0-5     Big-endian unsigned number of
                                       Unix epoch timestamp in
                                       milliseconds.
 version_and_sub_ms_precision  6-7     Sub millisecond clock precision
                                       encoded to fill all the possible
                                       values in 12 bits and version.
 variant_and_rand              8-15    CSPRNG 62 bits multiplexed
                                       with the version number.
